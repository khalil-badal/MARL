# AUDIT TRAIL (EDSA Ver — READABLE) — Group B3 Thesis, EDSA Backup Folder
# Plain-English companion to AUDIT_TRAIL.md in THIS folder (`EDSA Ver/`).
# Same entries, same order, but with LaTeX markup stripped so the actual
# sentences are easy to read.
#
# This is SEPARATE from the root-level audit trails, which track the live
# (Texas CapMetro) manuscript. These two files track only the .tex files
# inside `EDSA Ver/`.
#
# WHAT THIS FOLDER IS:
#   `EDSA Ver/` is the EDSA manuscript as it stood at the last main-line
#   commit before the Texas CapMetro pivot — the June 2024 defense manuscript
#   with all the 2026-08-06 panel (RTC) revisions applied, still on the
#   SafeTravelPH/EDSA dataset, waiting only for that dataset to be acquired.
#   It is the recovery point for the EDSA research direction.
#
# Format: every change has a bold **BEFORE** and **AFTER**, with the part that
# actually changed in **bold**. No "..." truncation of the key sentences.
#
# STATUS TAGS:
#   ACTIVE — the AFTER text is present in the current EDSA Ver files.
#
# NOTE ON STATUS TAGS BELOW: the entries dated 2026-08-06 were originally
# written for the root-level audit trail, where many are tagged SUPERSEDED
# because the 2026-08-24 Texas pivot later overwrote them. In THIS folder
# (EDSA Ver/), that pivot never happened, so every one of these 2026-08-06
# revisions has been individually re-verified against the actual EDSA Ver
# .tex files and is tagged ACTIVE here. Where EDSA Ver's exact wording
# differs slightly from what's quoted below (a handful of entries), a note
# says so; the substance of every fix and addition is present.

## 2026-08-06 — E1C3 — problem.tex, Section 2.2 (Research Gap)
**Status:** ACTIVE (verified present in EDSA Ver/problem.tex)

**BEFORE**

"It cannot be determined whether reported MARL gains persist, degrade gracefully, or collapse under realistic operating disturbances, which in turn blocks the transition of MARL bus scheduling from simulation to real urban transit deployment."

**AFTER**

"It cannot be determined whether reported MARL gains persist, degrade gracefully, or collapse under realistic operating disturbances, which in turn blocks the transition of MARL bus scheduling from simulation to real urban transit deployment. **The weather-disturbance class (W) in particular was identified through the literature survey conducted earlier in this study (the 'MARL Applied to Bus Scheduling' section), which found that no prior MARL bus-scheduling paper models heavy-tailed weather-induced travel-time delays (see the W column of the MARL literature table). Its operational relevance to the EDSA corridor is established by the rainfall-driven reductions in average speed and free-flow capacity documented in Section 1.1 (TSSP Rain 2018) and by the typhoon-related service suspensions on record for the corridor (DOTr 2020). The lognormal parameterization for this disturbance class follows the Kolmogorov-Smirnov-validated form from Patil et al., introduced here to address the resulting lack of temporally aligned, corridor-specific anomaly data (the 'Disturbance Gap' section).**"

**Why:** RTC comment 3 — the research gap section should explain how the weather disturbance column was arrived at.

## 2026-08-06 — E2C6 — introduction.tex 1.2.1, methods.tex Baseline Controllers
**Status:** ACTIVE (verified present in EDSA Ver — original wording, not the reworded Texas-pivot version)

**BEFORE (introduction.tex)**

"Allowing small headway perturbations to amplify into bunching (Daganzo 2009). Static schedules therefore remain mathematically inadequate for stochastic traffic environments, where the governing quantities are random variables rather than deterministic constants. These limitations motivated the transition toward more adaptive and data-driven scheduling methodologies."

**AFTER (introduction.tex)**

"Allowing small headway perturbations to amplify into bunching (Daganzo 2009). Static schedules therefore remain mathematically inadequate for stochastic traffic environments, where the governing quantities are random variables rather than deterministic constants. **Under the specific non-ideal conditions this study targets, the failure modes differ by control strategy. A fixed timetable has no feedback mechanism at all, so once bunching begins nothing in the schedule corrects it. A local reactive rule that holds a bus based only on the gap to the bus ahead can partially correct bunching under ordinary congestion, but has no way to respond to a breakdown, since it observes only the forward gap and not the enlarged gap a failed bus leaves behind it. A more globally aware reactive rule that accounts for both the forward and backward gap improves on this, but still follows a fixed, pre-specified rule rather than a learned response, so it cannot adapt its behavior to the heavier-tailed delays that severe weather introduces.** These limitations motivated the transition toward more adaptive and data-driven scheduling methodologies."

**BEFORE (methods.tex, No Control subsection, excerpt)**

"NC also provides the reference point for measuring the severity of bus bunching."

**AFTER (methods.tex, No Control subsection, excerpt)**

"NC also provides the reference point for measuring the severity of bus bunching. **Under non-ideal conditions, NC has no corrective mechanism whatsoever, so demand surges, weather-induced delays, and breakdowns are expected to compound directly into bunching with no attenuation.**"

Similar one-sentence additions were made to Forward Headway and Even Headway's subsections — FH can't see the backward gap a breakdown creates; EH has no way to anticipate weather's heavy-tailed delays.

**Why:** RTC comment 6 — explain how traditional non-AI scheduling performs under bunching/weather/breakdowns.

## 2026-08-06 — E2C7 — methods.tex, Section 3.2.10
**Status:** ACTIVE

**BEFORE**

"The acceptance criterion is twofold: (i) mean passenger waiting time no worse than Even Headway (no statistically significant degradation at p < 0.05 with multiple-comparison correction), and ideally a statistically significant improvement; and (ii) a statistically significant reduction in headway coefficient of variation relative to No Control."

**AFTER**

**Stage A acceptance criterion**

**(i)** Mean passenger waiting time no worse than EH (no statistically significant degradation at p < 0.05 with multiple-comparison correction), and ideally a statistically significant improvement.

**(ii)** A statistically significant reduction in headway coefficient of variation relative to NC.

**Stage B acceptance criterion:** The MARL policy is reported as performing well under disturbance if its mean waiting time stays below that of the best-performing baseline across the full sweep, with statistical significance under the same correction as Stage A.

**Why:** RTC comment 7 — describe what successful performance will look like, make it more visually prominent. No new thresholds were invented — only reformatted from inline sentence to labeled callout boxes.

## 2026-08-06 — E3C12 — introduction.tex, Section 1.2.3 (after Figure 1.3)
**Status:** ACTIVE

**BEFORE**

"Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) addresses the three limitations above by decomposing decision-making across multiple agents that share the environment."

(No text existed between Figure 1.3's caption and this sentence.)

**AFTER**

"**In both panels of Figure 1.3, the per-bus state (the same thing methods.tex calls s_i,t in its formal notation, shown in the figure as the local observation o_i) encodes the bus's current position, forward and backward headways, onboard load, and queue length at its current stop, as defined in full in the State Space section. The action is the holding-strength and stop-skipping decision the controller emits for that bus, defined in the Action Space section. In the SARL panel (a), a single centralized network ingests all N per-bus state vectors concatenated into one global state and outputs all N actions simultaneously; in the MARL panel (b), the same shared network weights instead process each bus's local state independently, so each agent acts on only its own observation rather than the concatenated global one.** Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) addresses the three limitations above by decomposing decision-making across multiple agents that share the environment."

**Why:** RTC comment 12 — explain the concepts in Figure 1.3 (bus states and actions).

## 2026-08-06 — E3C13 — introduction.tex Section 1.1, methods.tex Section 3.2.3
**Status:** ACTIVE

**BEFORE (introduction.tex)**

"Empirical studies on Philippine expressways show that increasing rainfall intensity significantly reduces average traffic speed and free-flow capacity (TSSP Rain 2018)."

**AFTER (introduction.tex)**

"Empirical studies on Philippine expressways show that increasing rainfall intensity significantly reduces average traffic speed and free-flow capacity (TSSP Rain 2018). **This rainfall-impact evidence is drawn from a 2018 study of the North Luzon Expressway rather than the EDSA Busway, and is used here only as contextual motivation that weather materially affects Philippine road-traffic operations; the weather-disturbance generator in this study does not adopt this study's specific speed-reduction percentages, and EDSA-specific travel-time behavior is independently calibrated through the GEH/RMSE procedure described in Section 3.2.3.**"

**BEFORE (methods.tex, Environment Model Validation opening)**

"The calibration is restricted to the bus corridor itself, since the agents' state and reward depend only on bus dynamics; surrounding mixed-traffic flows do not enter the Python environment."

**AFTER (methods.tex, Environment Model Validation opening)**

"The calibration is restricted to the bus corridor itself, since the agents' state and reward depend only on bus dynamics; surrounding mixed-traffic flows do not enter the Python environment. **This GEH/RMSE procedure calibrates EDSA-specific parameters directly from EDSA operational data and does not depend on the North Luzon Expressway rainfall-impact figures cited as motivating evidence in Section 1.1; that citation establishes only that weather materially affects Philippine road-traffic operations in general, not any EDSA-specific speed or capacity value used in this calibration.**"

**Why:** RTC comment 13 — Reference [10] is both dated (2018) and a different corridor (North Luzon Expressway, not EDSA); clarify whether its data was adopted or independently tuned for EDSA. This version fixes an earlier draft that only addressed the corridor-mismatch half, missing the "not quite new" recency half — caught during the cross-check against the verbatim RTC letter.

## 2026-08-06 — E3C8 — methods.tex, Section 3.2.6
**Status:** ACTIVE — including the original "W replaces T" design (EDSA Ver never received the Texas-pivot's "W composes with T" redesign)

**BEFORE**

"Four stochastic generators inject variability into the Python environment. Generators (i) and (ii) follow the perturbation framework of Wang and Sun; the weather generator's heavy-tailed lognormal formulation follows Patil et al.; the breakdown generator follows the rescheduling formulation of Cao et al. The notation table collects the symbols used across this section and the MARL formulation that follows."

(No definitions of the individual disturbance classes preceded this paragraph.)

**AFTER**

"**This study distinguishes five disturbance classes, denoted D, S, T, W, and B:**

- **Stochastic demand (D):** the baseline, always-present day-to-day randomness in passenger arrivals, drawn from the calibrated per-stop, per-time-of-day demand distributions. D is not a disturbance layered on top of a deterministic baseline — it IS the baseline stochastic environment, present in every run regardless of which other generators are active.
- **Demand surge (S):** an episode-level multiplicative scaling factor that amplifies baseline boarding rates above their empirical mean. S is the controlled experimental variable; D is always present, and S is what is added on top of it. Setting the standard deviation to 0 removes the surge and leaves only baseline demand variability (D).
- **Traffic-speed perturbation (T):** an episode-level scaling of corridor cruising speed, representing everyday congestion friction.
- **Weather-induced delay (W):** a per-segment travel-time distribution drawn from a right-skewed lognormal. W replaces T as the source of travel-time stochasticity once the intensity parameter exceeds zero.
- **Discrete bus breakdown (B):** a Poisson-distributed discrete event, with rate lambda, that permanently removes one bus from the active agent set for the remainder of the simulated day.

The generators that produce S, W, and B are sampled independently conditional on the always-active D and T baselines: no causal chain links them within the simulation. A breakdown does not trigger a demand surge or weather delay, and weather does not induce a mechanical failure. This factorial choice supports attribution in the single-disturbance ablations; it is not a claim that real disturbances are causally independent.**

Four stochastic generators inject variability into the Python environment..."

**Why:** RTC comment 8 — define each disturbance explicitly, clarify independence, distinguish stochastic demand from demand surge.

## 2026-08-06 — E3C15 — methods.tex, Section 3.2.4 (end)
**Status:** ACTIVE — with the original EDSA values (M=24, DOTr, SafeTravelPH), NOT the post-pivot Texas values shown in the root audit trail's AFTER block

**BEFORE**

"A condition is a state of the world; a controller is a choice of algorithm."

(Then moved straight into the "Data Processing" section — no parameter summary table existed.)

**AFTER (EDSA Ver's actual content — note this differs from the root file's AFTER, which shows post-pivot Texas values)**

"A condition is a state of the world; a controller is a choice of algorithm.

**Simulation parameter summary: fixed, swept/variable, and derived parameters (new table inserted here)**

| Parameter | Symbol | Value / Source |
|---|---|---|
| *Fixed* | | |
| Simulation horizon | — | Single simulated operating day (TODO-VAL: exact start/end hours) |
| Total stop count (sub-corridor) | M | 24 |
| Fleet size (active buses) | N | ≈ 12–30 |
| Control stop count | — | TODO-VAL: determined by criteria in Section 3.2.2 once dataset is processed |
| Scheduled headway | H₀ | TODO-VAL: from DOTr schedule records |
| Bus passenger capacity | — | TODO-VAL: from DOTr fleet specification |
| Maximum holding duration | ΔT | TODO-VAL: to be set during implementation |
| Holding action bins | Ω | {0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4} |
| Action space size per agent | \|Aᵢ\| | 10 (5 hold × 2 skip) |
| Monte Carlo runs per cell | N_runs | ≥ 30 |
| Discount / event-based discount | γ, β | TODO-VAL: tuned during implementation |

| Baseline inter-stop travel time | μ | Per-segment, per-time-of-day bin, TODO-DATA (SafeTravelPH dataset) |
| Baseline travel-time std. dev. | σ | Per-segment, per-time-of-day bin, TODO-DATA (SafeTravelPH dataset) |
| Baseline coefficient of variation | CV₀ | σ/μ per segment, TODO-DATA |
| Lognormal shape parameter | σ_ln | √(ln(η²+1)) |
| Lognormal location parameter | μ_ln | ln(μ) − σ_ln²/2 |

The table is the parameter reference for this chapter. Parameters marked TODO-VAL are to be confirmed during the implementation phase upon receipt of the operational dataset and DOTr schedule records; parameters marked TODO-DATA will be computed during the SUMO calibration phase. The stop count (M=24) and fleet-size range (N ≈ 12–30) are carried over from the state-space dimensionality discussion in the Introduction and are not new values introduced here."

**Why:** RTC comment 15 — summarize fixed and variable simulation parameters with target values.

## 2026-08-06 — E4C20 — methods.tex, Section 3.2.6 (four generator subsections)
**Status:** ACTIVE — all four sentences present (unlike the root manuscript, where the Texas pivot removed two of them)

**Passenger Demand**

**BEFORE:** "Sampling occurs at the start of each simulation run, producing varied demand profiles across episodes."

**AFTER:** "Sampling occurs at the start of each simulation run, producing varied demand profiles across episodes. **In implementation, the scaling factor f_d ~ N(1, σ_d²) is sampled once per episode at initialization and applied uniformly to every per-stop, per-time-of-day arrival rate for the duration of that simulated operating day, so all stops experience the same proportional demand shift within a single run while the shift itself varies across runs.**"

**Traffic Delays**

**BEFORE:** "Mean cruising speed between stops is adjusted dynamically using a scaling factor drawn from a normal distribution, clipped to [0.8, 1.2], representing typical daily congestion friction (Wang and Sun)."

**AFTER:** "Mean cruising speed between stops is adjusted dynamically using a scaling factor drawn from a normal distribution, clipped to [0.8, 1.2], representing typical daily congestion friction (Wang and Sun). **In implementation, the speed scaling factor f_s ~ N(1, σ_s²) is sampled once per episode and applied to the bus's mean cruising speed on every inter-stop segment traversal during that day, producing a uniformly slower or faster corridor for that run without segment-level variation beyond the calibrated baseline.** This generator provides the baseline stochastic variability in inter-stop travel time when the weather generator is inactive. When the weather generator is active (η > 0), the heavier-tailed lognormal replaces this scaling as the source of travel-time variability."

**Weather-Induced Anomalies**

**BEFORE:** "...regardless of its meteorological label."

**AFTER:** "...regardless of its meteorological label. **In implementation, when η > 0 a fresh travel-time sample T ~ LogNormal(μ_ln, σ_ln) is drawn independently for each bus at each inter-stop segment traversal during the episode, replacing the traffic-speed generator's output for that traversal; the lognormal parameters μ_ln and σ_ln are computed from the segment's empirical mean and the swept η via the method-of-moments equations given earlier.**"

**Bus Breakdowns**

**BEFORE:** "Breakdowns are triggered at random times sampled from a Poisson process with a configurable rate lambda (notation table)."

**AFTER:** "Breakdowns are triggered at random times sampled from a Poisson process with a configurable rate lambda (notation table). **In implementation, at each discrete simulation timestep of length dt, a Bernoulli trial with probability λ · dt is evaluated independently for each active bus; a success removes that bus from the active agent set for the remainder of the simulated day.**"

**Why:** RTC comment 20 — explain in detail how each disturbance scenario is actually simulated.

---

## 2026-08-06 — E4C21 — methods.tex, Sections 3.2.9 and 3.2.7
**Status:** ACTIVE — including the original observation-table row ("Disturbance intensity flag," not the Texas pivot's "Weather exposure/stress flag")

**BEFORE (3.2.9 opening)**

"For each (control strategy, disturbance level) cell, at least 30 independent Monte Carlo runs are executed using matched random seeds across strategies. Three response variables are logged per run: mean passenger waiting time, mean total travel time, and headway coefficient of variation."

**AFTER (3.2.9 opening)**

"**The three response variables logged per run are defined as follows. Mean passenger waiting time (W̄) is the average time elapsed from a passenger's arrival at a stop to their successful boarding, averaged across all passengers served and all stops over one simulated operating day: W̄ = (1/P) Σ (t_board − t_arrive), where P is the total number of passengers served. Mean total travel time (T̄) is the average elapsed time from a bus's departure from the origin terminal to its arrival at the final stop of the sub-corridor, averaged across all bus trips completed during the simulated day. Headway coefficient of variation (CV_h) measures headway regularity: CV_h = σ_h / μ_h, where σ_h and μ_h are the standard deviation and mean of observed inter-bus headways. CV_h = 0 denotes perfectly regular headways; larger values indicate increasing bunching severity.** For each (control strategy, disturbance level) cell, N ≥ 30 independent Monte Carlo runs are executed using matched random seeds across strategies."

**BEFORE (3.2.7 State Space, end of bullet list)**

"Environmental flags: encoded indicators for the current disturbance intensity and any active downstream incident or breakdown."

(Then jumped straight to the "Action Space" subsection.)

**AFTER (3.2.7 State Space, end of bullet list) — EDSA Ver's actual content**

"Environmental flags: encoded indicators for the current disturbance intensity and any active downstream incident or breakdown.

**Agent observation vector: features, symbols, and data sources (new table inserted here)**

| Feature | Deployment Source | Simulation Source |
|---|---|---|
| Control stop index | Route map (static) | Hardcoded stop list |
| Forward headway | AVL feed | Event-driven bus model |
| Estimated backward headway | AVL feed | Event-driven bus model |
| Onboard passenger count | APC system | Running tally in bus model |
| Waiting passenger count at stop | AFC terminal / platform sensors | Stop queue in bus model |
| Disturbance intensity flag | Weather API / public incident alert | Active generator parameter |
| Downstream incident / breakdown flag | Incident management system | Breakdown generator output |

In simulation, all observation features are generated synthetically by the Python environment at each control event by querying the analytical bus model and combining outputs from the stochastic generators; no real sensor data is consumed during training or evaluation."

**Why:** RTC comment 21 — include details on the metrics and description of observation features.

---

## 2026-08-06 — E1C1+E2C5+E4C22 — REVERTED, no net change
**Status:** REVERTED (confirmed: EDSA Ver does not contain the drafted SafeTravelPH description block — the revert held)

**BEFORE**

"Corridor bus operational data. A per-trip record of EDSA Carousel bus operation along the study sub-corridor... The baseline operating point for this study is established from a crowdsourced operational record collected from the EDSA Busway during July 2023 through the SafeTravelPH mobile application."

"Severe-weather conditions are not estimated from operational data in this study but are injected as a controlled experimental variable..."

**DRAFTED (never committed)**

"Corridor bus operational data..." [same as before]

"**The baseline operating point described above is grounded in the SafeTravelPH dataset: a crowdsourced mobile application through which commuters submit trip-level GPS trajectory reports while travelling along Philippine transit corridors... Each submission corresponds to a single commuter trip and yields a per-trip trajectory log... The dataset comprises TODO-DATA: insert total trip record count...**"

[Table: SafeTravelPH dataset fields and their role in simulation calibration — 6 rows]

"**A secondary source of station-level ridership aggregates... is to be acquired from the Department of Transportation (DOTr) under the Freedom of Information framework...**"

"Severe-weather conditions are not estimated from operational data in this study..."

**REVERTED TO (final, pushed state — also EDSA Ver's current state)**

Same as BEFORE — the drafted block was removed entirely before any commit.

**Why reverted:** the user caught this before any commit — the group doesn't actually have access to the SafeTravelPH dataset yet, and even though the numbers were placeholder-tagged, the qualitative description asserted more familiarity with the dataset than is currently honest.

## 2026-08-06 — Citation fix: Patil2025Conformal — methods.tex, Section 3.2.6
**Status:** ACTIVE (verified present — EDSA Ver never received the Texas pivot's later composition redesign of this section)

**BEFORE**

"Patil et al. validated this parameterization against INRIX freeway data via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, reporting a close fit at the highest variability level they tested (KS = 0.036, p = 0.94 at CV = 1.0)."

**AFTER**

"Patil et al. **tested this parameterization by generating SUMO-simulated travel times under the same CV-driven lognormal recipe, with time windows and mean travel times anchored to INRIX historical data for an urban arterial corridor, not a freeway, and confirming via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test that the simulated distribution matches the assumed log-normal shape**, reporting a close fit at the highest variability level they tested (KS = 0.036, p = 0.94 at CV = 1.0)."

**Why:** checked against the actual paper. Its own Table V classifies the test route as "Local, Minor/Principal Arterials" — not a freeway. Also, the KS test checks whether SUMO-simulated travel times follow the assumed log-normal shape; it isn't a direct comparison against INRIX's own data. The numeric KS/p values themselves were confirmed correct — only the description of what was tested and against what changed.

---

## 2026-08-06 — Citation fix: Rodriguez2023Cooperative — methods.tex, Section 3.2.7
**Status:** ACTIVE — the substance of the fix (broader 10-action space vs. Rodriguez's 6 mutually-exclusive actions; 60-80% driver-compliance detail) is present in EDSA Ver, though phrased slightly differently than the root file's AFTER quote below

**BEFORE**

"A continuous holding parameter was considered but rejected for three reasons. First, continuous actions require actor-critic algorithms with training instability. Second, Rodriguez et al. showed that a 5-bin discretization achieves combined holding-and-skipping control on a comparable corridor without measurable loss of performance versus continuous formulations. Third, real driver compliance with second-level holding instructions is itself coarse, so continuous precision is not meaningful at deployment."

**AFTER (root file's quoted version)**

**"This study's action space (10 discrete actions: 5 holding strengths times 2 skip choices, selected independently) is broader than Rodriguez et al.'s combined holding-and-skipping controller, which instead selects among 6 mutually exclusive actions: 5 holding strengths, where zero-strength already covers 'no holding,' plus a single separate skip action. The same 5-value holding-strength set is used in both studies."** A continuous holding parameter was considered but rejected for two reasons: continuous actions require actor-critic algorithms with training instability, and **"real driver compliance with holding instructions is itself imperfect — Rodriguez et al. model non-compliant drivers as executing only 60-80% of the instructed holding time"** — so continuous precision isn't meaningful at deployment anyway.

**EDSA Ver's actual current wording (same fix, same facts, different phrasing):**

"The full action set is the Cartesian product of these two components: 10 discrete actions per control event, allowing the agent to select a holding strength and a skip decision independently at each control event. **This is a broader action space than Rodriguez et al., whose combined holding-and-skipping controller (DDQN-HA) instead selects among six mutually exclusive actions: five holding strengths (with zero already covering the no-holding case) plus a single skip action. The discretized holding-strength set adopted here matches theirs exactly.** A continuous holding parameter was considered, following Wang and Sun, but rejected for two reasons. First, continuous actions require actor-critic algorithms, whose training instability compounds across the swept-disturbance evaluation budget. Second, **real driver compliance with holding instructions is itself imperfect: Rodriguez et al. model non-compliant drivers as departing after only 60–80% of the instructed holding time**, so continuous precision is not meaningful at deployment."

**Why:** checked against the full paper. No comparison against a continuous action space exists anywhere in it — that claim was unsupported and has been removed. Rodriguez's actual action space is a 6-way mutually exclusive choice, not a 10-way independent combination like this thesis's own design — the description was corrected to reflect that difference honestly, while keeping this thesis's own 10-action design unchanged.

---

## 2026-08-06 — Citation fix: Wangsun — methods.tex, Section 3.2.6
**Status:** ACTIVE

**BEFORE**

"The baseline empirical transit demand is perturbed each episode by a scaling factor clipped to [1, 3], following Wang and Sun. The upper bound of 3 corresponds to roughly a tripling of baseline boarding rates, spanning the range observed during major event let-outs and severe-weather mode shifts."

**AFTER**

"The baseline empirical transit demand is perturbed each episode by a scaling factor sampled from a normal distribution and clipped to [1, 3], **following the general Gaussian-clipped demand-scaling mechanism of Wang and Sun, though this study adopts a narrower clip than their [1, 10] range**. The asymmetric clip focuses the test on demand surges rather than symmetric variation, since demand drops produce lightly loaded conditions that do not stress-test the controller. The upper bound of 3, corresponding to roughly a tripling of baseline boarding rates, **is this study's own choice (flagged to revisit against Wang and Sun's wider range during implementation) rather than a value drawn from prior work**."

**Why:** checked against the actual paper. Their own equation clips the demand-scaling factor to [1, 10], not [1, 3] — and the "event let-outs" justification for the number 3 doesn't appear anywhere in their paper either. Kept the study's own [1, 3] choice, since changing it would be a real experimental redesign, not a citation fix, but stopped implying that specific number came from Wang and Sun.

## 2026-08-06 — E3C9 + E2C4 — introduction.tex, after Section 1.2.2 (SARL)
**Status:** ACTIVE — including the original Verbich & El-Geneidy row (EDSA Ver never received the Texas pivot's later swap to a Sun et al. row)

**BEFORE**

"...which motivates the MARL choice here while acknowledging this caveat."

(Then jumped straight to the "Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning" section — no ML/SARL disturbance table existed.)

**AFTER**

"...which motivates the MARL choice here while acknowledging this caveat.

**To situate the MARL literature reviewed in the next subsection within the broader ML and SARL landscape, this table extends the paradigm comparison of Table 1.1 with a disturbance-coverage column, using the same D/S/T/W/B notation as the main MARL comparison table.**"

**Disturbance coverage across ML and SARL vehicle-scheduling studies (new table):**

| Paper | Paradigm | Method | Disturbances |
|---|---|---|---|
| Wang et al. | ML (data-driven) | Bus scheduling incorporating time-dependent traffic and demand | D |
| Barrera Hernandez et al. | ML-assisted (heuristic dispatcher) | Passenger-demand forecasting supporting a heuristic dispatcher | D |
| Zhao et al. | SARL | STDH-DQN; self-attention state encoder over spatial-temporal AVL features | D, T |
| Zhang and Zheng | SARL | SA-DRL; categorical identity features | D, T |
| Verbich and El-Geneidy | Heuristic (non-MARL) | Dynamic transit control under severe weather and vehicle breakdowns | W, B |

"**The funnel is now complete: no ML or SARL study covers W or B, and among MARL studies, only Verbich and El-Geneidy's heuristic controller addresses both, and it's explicitly non-MARL. Patil et al. similarly validate weather-induced travel-time distributions but don't address bus control at all; their contribution here is the lognormal parameterization for the weather generator, not a bus-control baseline. No prior study, ML, SARL, or MARL, combines W and B coverage with an actual MARL bus-scheduling controller, which is the specific gap this study fills.**"

**Why:** RTC comment 9 (asks for an ML/SARL disturbance table) and comment 4 (asks for a severe-weather comparison study) — solved together, since Verbich & El-Geneidy is exactly what comment 4 wants and fits naturally as a row here.

## 2026-08-06 — E3C10 — introduction.tex, before Table 1.2 discussion
**Status:** ACTIVE — including the original "Only Shi et al. carries a breakdown (B) entry" claim (EDSA Ver never received the Texas pivot's later reclassification of Shi et al. to D,T)

**BEFORE**

"Table 1.2 summarizes what each study evaluated, what disturbances it modeled, and what it reported."

**AFTER**

"**Only Shi et al. carries a breakdown (B) entry in Table 1.2. Cao et al., who also model discrete vehicle failures, are deliberately excluded from this count: their MARL application is to train rescheduling, not bus scheduling, so they don't belong in a table scoped to MARL bus-control literature. Verbich and El-Geneidy likewise model breakdowns but use heuristic, non-MARL control (see the ML/SARL table), so they're excluded for the same reason. Among MARL bus-scheduling studies specifically, Shi et al. remains the only one to model discrete breakdowns.** Table 1.2 summarizes what each study evaluated, what disturbances it modeled, and what it reported."

**Why:** RTC comment 10 — the table shows only one breakdown paper but the presentation reportedly showed two. Could not confirm what was actually shown, since there was no slide access at the time, so used the RTC letter's own suggested fallback: explain why the two "candidate" second papers are correctly excluded, rather than guessing at an unverified row.

## 2026-08-06 — E3C11 — figure caption attribution (introduction.tex, methods.tex)
**Status:** ACTIVE

**BEFORE** (example — Figure 1.3 caption)

"Comparison of single-agent and multi-agent formulations. (a) SARL: a centralized policy consumes the concatenated global state and outputs a joint action covering every bus. (b) MARL with parameter sharing: a single set of weights is shared across N agents, each acting on its own local observation o_i."

(Same pattern for Figures 1.4, 3.1–3.5 — captions ended with no source attribution.)

**AFTER** (example — Figure 1.3 caption)

"Comparison of single-agent and multi-agent formulations. (a) SARL: a centralized policy consumes the concatenated global state and outputs a joint action covering every bus. (b) MARL with parameter sharing: a single set of weights is shared across N agents, each acting on its own local observation o_i. **Authors' illustration.**"

(Same "Authors' illustration." appended to all 7 original diagram captions. Figures 1.1 and 1.2 already had proper citations and were unchanged.)

**Why:** RTC comment 11 — some figures lack citations; original diagrams should say so explicitly rather than looking uncredited.

## 2026-08-06 — E3C14 — problem.tex, Delimitations (a)
**Status:** ACTIVE

**BEFORE**

"(a) Due to computational constraints, the simulation is restricted to a defined operational sub-segment of the EDSA Carousel corridor rather than the entire metropolitan road network. The restriction is justified by the need to preserve 1:1 empirical traffic volumes for GEH calibration without resorting to flow scaling; corresponding GEH calibration statistics are reported in Chapter 4."

**AFTER**

"(a) Due to computational constraints, the simulation is restricted to a defined operational sub-segment of the EDSA Carousel corridor rather than the entire metropolitan road network, **and minor feeder roads leading into the corridor are not modeled. Both restrictions are justified by the same structural fact: the EDSA Carousel operates on a physically separated, barrier-protected busway, so the agents' state and reward depend only on bus dynamics within the dedicated lane, specifically headways, dwell times, and onboard loads, none of which are directly observed by or computed from feeder-road traffic. Feeder roads affect the corridor only indirectly, through the passenger arrival rates they produce at each stop, and that effect is already captured by the calibrated per-stop demand distributions without needing to simulate the feeder network itself. Modeling feeder roads in SUMO would add computational cost without adding any new information the agents' observation or reward could use, since** the sub-corridor restriction also preserves 1:1 empirical traffic volumes for GEH calibration without resorting to flow scaling; corresponding GEH calibration statistics are reported in Chapter 4."

**Why:** RTC comment 14 — explain why minor roads leading to the corridor are excluded from the simulation.

## 2026-08-06 — E3C16 — figure/table callout sweep (introduction.tex, methods.tex)
**Status:** ACTIVE — all 10 callouts verified present (wording of one, the training-loop callout, differs slightly: "standard reinforcement-learning feedback loop" instead of "standard RL feedback loop")

Ten short additions, each linking an existing sentence to a figure/table that was never explicitly named anywhere in the prose:

| Location | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Ridership stat (intro) | "up from 63.02M in 2024." | "up from 63.02M in 2024 **(Figure 1.1)**." |
| Rainfall stat (intro) | "The reduction in average speeds are about 5.34% under light rain conditions." | "**As Figure 1.2 shows,** the reduction in average speeds are about 5.34% under light rain conditions." |
| CTDE intro (intro) | "Most modern formulations use Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE)." | "Most modern formulations use CTDE, **illustrated in Figure 1.4**." |
| Pipeline intro (methods) | "The pipeline proceeds in two phases." | "**As shown in Figure 3.1,** the pipeline proceeds in two phases." |
| GEH statistic (methods) | "It measures the discrepancy between simulated and observed hourly bus volumes on individual corridor segments." | "It measures the discrepancy between simulated and observed hourly bus volumes, **illustrated in panel (a) of Figure 3.2**." |
| RMSE (methods) | "RMSE evaluates how closely simulated bus speed trajectories match empirical observations." | "RMSE evaluates how closely simulated bus speed trajectories match empirical observations, **illustrated in panel (b) of Figure 3.2**." |
| Parameter table close (methods) | "Parameters marked TODO-VAL are to be confirmed during the implementation phase." | "**Table 3.2 therefore serves as the single reference point for every parameter used across this chapter.** Parameters marked TODO-VAL are to be confirmed during the implementation phase." |
| Observation features (methods) | "In simulation, all observation features are generated synthetically." | "**As Table 3.3 shows,** in simulation all observation features are generated synthetically." |
| Training loop (methods) | "The learning process follows the standard RL feedback loop." | "The learning process follows the standard reinforcement-learning feedback loop..., **illustrated in Figure 3.3**." |
| Stage A (methods) | "They are each run for at least 30 Monte Carlo iterations with matched seeds." | "Matched seeds, **reported in the format shown in Figure 3.4**." |
| Stage B (methods) | "With the breakdown generator active at each level." | "Active at each level, **using the Monte Carlo evaluation procedure illustrated in Figure 3.5**." |

**Why:** RTC comment 16 — figures and tables should be called and discussed in the paragraphs, not just placed. Found 10 with zero references despite adjacent topical discussion; added one reference each without touching the discussion itself. Table 3.1, the notation table and the RTC's own example of a too-thin callout, was checked and already has 5 separate substantive references elsewhere in the chapter, so no fix was needed there.

## 2026-08-06 — E3C18 + E3C19 — main.tex preamble
**Status:** ACTIVE — verified: `\usepackage{setspace}` present, `\onehalfspacing` present, `\linenumbers` uncommented in EDSA Ver/main.tex

This entry is a preamble-only change (no manuscript prose changed). See AUDIT_TRAIL.md (in this folder) for the exact LaTeX diff. In summary: added the setspace package, added onehalfspacing after begin-document, and uncommented the linenumbers command.

**Why:** RTC comments 18 and 19 — 1.5 line spacing and line numbers for the non-final manuscript. Applied last, after all other content edits in this revision round, per CLAUDE.md's own guidance to avoid disrupting line references mid-revision.

---

## 2026-08-06 — E1C2 — methods.tex, Section 3.2.5 (end)
**Status:** ACTIVE — the field-mapping table (`tab:field-mapping`) is compiled/live in EDSA Ver (unlike the root manuscript, where the Texas pivot buried it inside an `\iffalse` block)

**BEFORE**

"Severe-weather conditions are not estimated from operational data in this study but are injected as a controlled experimental variable, with disturbance magnitudes anchored to validated literature values rather than to a corridor-specific severe-weather sample."

(The required-datasets bullet list ended and went straight to this sentence — no mapping table existed.)

**AFTER**

"**Table 3.2 maps each required raw field to the parameter derived from it and the MARL component that parameter feeds into, connecting the data requirements above to the disturbance generators, the control-stop selection criteria, and the agent observation vector. The mapping reflects the study's design intent, not properties of a processed dataset; specific statistics remain TODO-DATA pending dataset acquisition.**

| Raw Field | Derived Parameter | MARL Component |
|---|---|---|
| GPS-tracked vehicle location | Per-segment travel-time distribution | SUMO speed calibration; anchors traffic-speed and weather generators |
| Boarding events | Per-stop demand rate | Demand-surge generator baseline; waiting-count observation feature |
| Alighting events | Through-passenger volume per stop | Control-stop selection criterion 3 (avoid high through-volume stops) |
| Passenger occupancy | Per-segment load profile | Onboard-count observation feature; dwell-time estimation |
| Operating speed | Per-segment cruising speed | SUMO volume calibration; traffic-speed generator baseline |
| Dwell time | Per-stop dwell distribution | Event-driven bus model, advances the simulation clock |

"Severe-weather conditions are not estimated from operational data in this study but are injected as a controlled experimental variable, with disturbance magnitudes anchored to validated literature values rather than to a corridor-specific severe-weather sample."

**Bug caught while drafting:** one of the new cross-references initially pointed at the wrong section — the data pre-processing pipeline instead of control-stop selection, which didn't have a label yet. Added the missing label and fixed both references before finalizing.

**Why:** RTC comment 2 — map dataset fields to the study's proposed features. Judged safe without dataset access, since it connects two things already spelled out elsewhere in the manuscript (required fields, MARL components) rather than describing the dataset itself.

---

## 2026-08-06 — E3C17 — introduction.tex (Background), methods.tex (Weather-Induced Anomalies)
**Status:** ACTIVE — both the corridor map figure and the η-sweep basis table are compiled/live in EDSA Ver (unlike the root manuscript, where the Texas pivot buried the corridor map inside an `\iffalse` block)

**BEFORE**

The corridor was described in prose only, with no map figure. The Introduction had two figures (ridership, rainfall impact). The η disturbance-intensity sweep values were explained in prose only, with no table.

**AFTER**

**Added a new figure right after the ridership figure: the EDSA Carousel corridor map** (Monumento to PITX route with jeepney, MRT, LRT, tricycle, and UV/FX transport-mode legend at each stop), extracted from the group's defense presentation. **Added a new table right after the existing η-sweep prose in methods.tex**, listing each η value (0.0, 0.3, 0.6, 1.0, 1.3) alongside its basis (generator off, inside Patil et al.'s validated range, top of validated range, or extrapolated stress test) — the existing prose explaining this was kept unchanged, the table just gives readers a quick-reference version.

**Why:** RTC comment 17 — include figures/tables shown in the defense but missing from the manuscript. All 58 slides of the defense deck were reviewed against the manuscript; most content (SARL vs MARL, CTDE, calibration formulas, parameter notation, training-vs-execution protocol) duplicated what's already written — adding it again would just repeat existing material. These two were the genuinely new items. The corridor map specifically matches the example the RTC letter itself gave for what might be missing.

**Judged out of scope, not added:** Work Plan Gantt charts (project timeline, not manuscript content) and a software/tools appendix (SUMO, PettingZoo, PyTorch, and so on — implementation detail for later, not this revision round).

**Important:** this repo doesn't have a `Figures/` folder for any of the existing images — they live only on Overleaf. A `Figures/` folder was created locally just to hold the new map image. The user needs to upload `bg_fig3_edsa_corridor_map.pdf` to Overleaf's Figures folder too, or the new figure won't show up when compiled there.

## 2026-08-06 — N2 (self-identified, not RTC) — problem.tex, Section 2.3 (Significance)
**Status:** ACTIVE — restored to EDSA Ver on 2026-08-25 after being found missing from the initial (contaminated) backup snapshot; see the 2026-08-25 restoration entry below

**BEFORE**

"This study contributes both practical and scientific significance."

**AFTER**

"This study contributes both practical and scientific significance. **MARL is the control method under evaluation in this study; the corridor's service reliability under disturbance is the object of study it is applied to measure, which is why practical significance is discussed first.**"

**Why:** self-identified, prompted by the user's recollection that a panelist questioned during Q&A whether the study reads as more focused on MARL than on bus scheduling. This isn't in the official RTC decision letter's 22 written items, so it's treated as an oral/impression-level concern rather than a formal requirement. States the thesis's own positioning explicitly instead of leaving readers to infer it from section ordering.

**Note:** since this isn't an RTC panel comment, it doesn't get a row in the conformity-of-revisions table.

---

## 2026-08-06 — N2 (self-identified, not RTC) — problem.tex, Section 2.2 (Research Gap)
**Status:** ACTIVE — restored to EDSA Ver on 2026-08-25 after being found missing from the initial (contaminated) backup snapshot; see the 2026-08-25 restoration entry below

**BEFORE**

"Without this characterization, it cannot be determined whether reported MARL gains persist, degrade gracefully, or collapse under realistic operating disturbances, which in turn blocks the transition of MARL bus scheduling from simulation to real urban transit deployment."

**AFTER**

"Without this characterization, it cannot be determined whether reported MARL gains persist, degrade gracefully, or collapse under realistic operating disturbances, which in turn blocks the transition of MARL bus scheduling from simulation to real urban transit deployment. **This joint-disturbance framing reflects two independently-documented, concurrent operational realities of the same corridor rather than only a gap in existing comparison tables: EDSA experiences both weather-driven service disruptions (Mangaluz, 2024; PIA emergency-response reporting) and chronic mechanical-failure risk (Chua, 2026) as ongoing features of its operating environment, so a controller validated against each in isolation provides no evidence of how it behaves when a transit operator's actual risk exposure includes both at once. The disturbance generators remain independently sampled within the simulation (Section 3.2.6); this operational context motivates evaluating their union, not a claim that the two are causally or temporally linked.**"

**Why:** self-identified. Grounds the "combined disturbance" framing in a real, citable fact about EDSA's operating environment rather than presenting the combination as valuable only because no prior comparison table has filled that cell. Also explicitly reaffirms that the disturbance generators remain independently sampled (established earlier in the methods chapter), so this addition doesn't contradict that existing design choice.

**Citation check performed first:** an earlier draft tried to claim breakdowns and weather delays cluster in the same wet-season months, citing a DPWH road-repair-closure article and a single flooding article. Checked both sources before writing anything into the manuscript: the road-repair article is about infrastructure closures, not documented bus breakdowns, and doesn't establish a weather cause; the flooding article is one dated event, not evidence of a recurring seasonal pattern. Neither supported the clustering claim, so it was dropped in favor of the weaker but fully-supported "two documented, concurrent risks" framing actually used above.

**Note:** since this isn't an RTC panel comment, it doesn't get a row in the conformity-of-revisions table.

## 2026-08-06 — N1 (self-identified, not RTC) — methods.tex, Section 3.2.7
**Status:** ACTIVE

**BEFORE**

"This study defines the reward structure for the hybrid action space, the three component terms above, and treats their relative weighting, plus a sensitivity analysis over those weights, as the implementation-phase deliverable (EO 2.1). The component structure is fixed; the coefficients are not yet finalized."

**AFTER**

"This study defines the reward structure for the hybrid action space, the three component terms above, and treats their relative weighting, plus a sensitivity analysis over those weights, as the implementation-phase deliverable (EO 2.1). The component structure is fixed; the coefficients are not yet finalized. **The reward is computed individually for each agent at every control event, not as a shared team-level signal: r_i,t is agent i's own entry in the transition tuple written to the shared replay buffer, so each bus is scored on the consequences of its own action even though all agents update the same shared network. Locally-observable quantities already in the agent's local observation, principally the forward and backward headway components, let this individual signal still reflect corridor-wide regularity without requiring a centralized reward computation at execution time. The three priorities combine additively as a weighted sum of per-event penalty terms:**

**r(i, t+k) = −w₁ · (headway-irregularity term) − w₂ · (waiting-time term) − w₃ · (skip-degeneracy term)**

**with weights w₁, w₂, w₃ left as placeholders to be tuned as the Expected Output 2.1 sensitivity analysis. Each term is expressed as a non-positive penalty, so the agent maximizes its expected return by simultaneously minimizing headway irregularity, passenger waiting, and degenerate skipping; this sign convention, not the specific per-term formulas or their relative weights, is what this chapter fixes ahead of implementation.**"

**Why:** self-identified gap, not an RTC comment. The existing text explained the reward's *priorities* and said the *weighting* is deferred to implementation, but never said whether the reward is individual or shared, how the priorities combine into one number, or the sign convention. Added those three things without touching the existing structure/weighting distinction or specifying any coefficient value.

**Note:** since this isn't an RTC panel comment, it doesn't get a row in the conformity-of-revisions table.

## 2026-08-06 — N1 rewrite (user-provided prose) — methods.tex, Section 3.2.7
**Status:** REPLACED BY N1's original wording in EDSA Ver — see note below

**Note:** this stylistic rewrite of N1 was applied to the root manuscript on 2026-08-06 (same day), but EDSA Ver's methods.tex retains N1's *original* wording (the block shown in the N1 entry directly above), not this polished rewrite. This is not a gap or an error — `EDSA Ver/` was forked from a commit that predates this particular same-day rewrite. The underlying content (reward structure, individual-vs-shared computation, sign convention, equation) is identical in substance in both versions; only the prose style differs. If the group wants EDSA Ver to also carry the polished rewrite, that can be applied as a small additional edit.

**BEFORE (the rewrite's starting point — same as N1's AFTER above)**

"This study defines the reward structure for the hybrid action space, the three component terms above, and treats their relative weighting, plus a sensitivity analysis over those weights, as the implementation-phase deliverable (EO 2.1). The component structure is fixed; the coefficients are not yet finalized. The reward is computed individually for each agent at every control event, not as a shared team-level signal: r_i,t is agent i's own entry in the transition tuple written to the shared replay buffer, so each bus is scored on the consequences of its own action even though all agents update the same shared network. Locally-observable quantities already in the agent's observation, principally the forward and backward headway components, let this individual signal still reflect corridor-wide regularity without requiring a centralized reward computation at execution time. The three priorities combine additively as a weighted sum of per-event penalty terms: [equation] with weights left as placeholders to be tuned as the Expected Output 2.1 sensitivity analysis. Each term is expressed as a non-positive penalty, so the agent maximizes its expected return by simultaneously minimizing headway irregularity, passenger waiting, and degenerate skipping; this sign convention, not the specific per-term formulas or their relative weights, is what this chapter fixes ahead of implementation."

**AFTER (the polished rewrite — NOT currently in EDSA Ver)**

**"This study establishes the overall reward structure for the hybrid action space by defining the three reward components and their additive formulation, while treating the corresponding weighting coefficients, together with their sensitivity analysis, as the implementation-phase deliverable under Expected Output 2.1. Although the component structure is fixed at this stage, the coefficients remain as placeholders to be determined during implementation through experimental evaluation.**

**The reward is computed independently for each agent at every control event rather than as a shared team-level objective. Accordingly, r_i,t represents the reward assigned to agent i and is stored as that agent's transition in the shared replay buffer. Each bus is therefore evaluated based on the consequences of its own action, even though all agents learn from a common shared network. Since the reward is derived from locally observable quantities already contained in the agent's observation, particularly the forward and backward headway measurements, the resulting signal remains aligned with corridor-wide service regularity without requiring a centralized reward computation during execution.**

**The overall reward function is expressed as the weighted sum of three penalty terms:** [same equation as before, unchanged] **where w₁, w₂, and w₃ denote the weighting coefficients to be determined through the Expected Output 2.1 sensitivity analysis. Each component is formulated as a non-positive penalty, allowing the agent to maximize its cumulative return by minimizing headway irregularity, passenger waiting time, and unnecessary stop-skipping behavior. Consequently, this chapter establishes the reward formulation and its optimization objective, while the specific mathematical expressions and coefficient values are reserved for the implementation and evaluation phase.**"

**Why:** the user supplied polished replacement prose for the N1 addition and asked that it be applied directly (to the root manuscript). The equation itself is unchanged — only the surrounding explanatory prose was rewritten. Not yet applied to EDSA Ver.

## 2026-08-25 — EDSA Ver restoration: strip CapMetro contamination, align to the true pre-pivot state
**Status:** ACTIVE
**Commits:** `299901a` (CapMetro cleanup), `42bfdb8` (alignment to the pre-pivot state)

### What happened, in one paragraph

When the `EDSA Ver/` backup was first created (during the Texas pivot), it was
populated from a transitional copy that had **already replaced the SafeTravelPH
dataset with the CapMetro Route 801 dataset** in its dataset sections — and it
was **missing two of the group's own self-identified additions (N2)** that the
real pre-pivot manuscript had. In short, the backup was not a clean "EDSA +
revisions" copy; it was a half-migrated hybrid. The changes below strip out all
the CapMetro/Texas content and put back the missing pieces, so `EDSA Ver/` now
faithfully reproduces the real pre-pivot EDSA manuscript (defense + all
2026-08-06 panel revisions, SafeTravelPH dataset, no Texas anywhere).

After these fixes: the Introduction and Methods chapters are identical to the
real pre-pivot manuscript, and the Problem Statement differs only by a typo fix
(a stray "TThe" corrected to "The") and some trailing spaces.

---

### 1. problem.tex — Scope section

**BEFORE**

"This study develops and evaluates a MARL-based bus scheduling framework for **a BRT corridor**. The framework is built on a calibrated SUMO microsimulation and runs over a single-day operational horizon..."

Followed by a whole extra paragraph: "**The simulation is calibrated against a six-month Automatic Passenger Counter (APC) archive from Capital Metro Route 801 (Austin, TX, July–December 2021), comprising 229,421 validated stop-level event records across 184 service days and 29 stops, with 420,201 total recorded boardings. Weather conditions during the same period are captured via NOAA hourly surface observations. The dataset, cleaning methodology, and derived parameters are described in detail in Chapter 3, Section 3.2.5.**"

**AFTER**

"This study develops and evaluates a MARL-based bus scheduling framework for **the EDSA Carousel corridor**. The framework is built on a calibrated SUMO microsimulation and runs over a single-day operational horizon..."

**The entire Capital Metro / Austin / NOAA calibration paragraph was removed.** The Scope now flows straight into the definition of non-ideal conditions, as in the defense manuscript.

---

### 2. problem.tex — Research Gap (restored the missing N2 addition)

**BEFORE**

The Research Gap paragraph ended at: "...which in turn blocks the transition of MARL bus scheduling from simulation to real urban transit deployment." (The N2 sentence was missing from the backup.)

**AFTER**

The same paragraph, now with the N2 addition restored: "...which in turn blocks the transition of MARL bus scheduling from simulation to real urban transit deployment. **This joint-disturbance framing reflects two independently-documented, concurrent operational realities of the same corridor rather than only a gap in existing comparison tables: EDSA experiences both weather-driven service disruptions (Philstar typhoon reporting; PIA emergency-response reporting) and chronic mechanical-failure risk (Chua, 2026) as ongoing features of its operating environment, so a controller validated against each in isolation provides no evidence of how it behaves when a transit operator's actual risk exposure includes both at once. The disturbance generators remain independently sampled within the simulation (Section 3.2.6); this operational context motivates evaluating their union, not a claim that the two are causally or temporally linked.**"

---

### 3. problem.tex — Significance (restored the missing N2 addition)

**BEFORE**

"This study contributes both practical and scientific significance."

**AFTER**

"This study contributes both practical and scientific significance. **MARL is the control method under evaluation in this study; the corridor's service reliability under disturbance is the object of study it is applied to measure, which is why practical significance is discussed first.**"

---

### 4. methods.tex — Required Datasets (CapMetro dataset → SafeTravelPH/EDSA dataset)

**BEFORE**

Three CapMetro bullets: a "primary" bullet describing the **Capital Metro (CapMetro) APC raw archive for July–December 2021 (Socrata im6q-3pc9), 9,197,694 records across 47 fields**; a paragraph naming **MetroRapid Route 801 (North Lamar/South Congress BRT), direction code 6, New Flyer XDE60 buses, 123-passenger crush capacity, 29 stops over 20 miles**; a cleaning paragraph citing **229,421 records / 420,201 boardings**; a **NOAA weather** secondary bullet (Camp Mabry / Austin-Bergstrom); and a **2021 NTD Revenue Vehicle Inventory** supplementary bullet.

**AFTER**

A single EDSA bullet, restored from the defense manuscript: "**Corridor bus operational data.** A per-trip record of EDSA Carousel bus operation along the study sub-corridor, collected over a continuous observation window of at least two weeks. The required fields are GPS-tracked vehicle location, boarding and alighting events, passenger occupancy, operating speed, and dwell time at each stop... **The baseline operating point for this study is established from a crowdsourced operational record collected from the EDSA Busway during July 2023 through the SafeTravelPH mobile application.**" (Plus the original commented-out note about supplementary MMDA/DOTr/FOI records.)

---

### 5. methods.tex — Field-mapping table (CapMetro column names → generic EDSA fields)

**BEFORE** (raw-field column used CapMetro database field names)

departure_dtm + GPS coordinates · ons (boardings per stop visit) · offs (alightings per stop visit) · load, max_load · derived from consecutive departure_dtm · derived from stop_sequence timing

The intro sentence also said "**All listed fields are present in the CapMetro APC archive.**"

**AFTER** (raw-field column uses the study's generic data requirements)

**GPS-tracked vehicle location · Boarding events · Alighting events · Passenger occupancy · Operating speed · Dwell time**

The intro sentence now reads: "**The mapping reflects the study's design intent, not properties of a processed dataset; specific statistics remain TODO-DATA pending dataset acquisition.**" (The middle "Derived Parameter" and "MARL Component" columns were unchanged.)

---

### 6. methods.tex — Severe-weather paragraphs (removed the NOAA-join framing)

**BEFORE**

"Severe-weather conditions are not estimated from operational data alone. **The NOAA weather join (Stage 2 of the pipeline) identifies which service days experienced measurable precipitation** and provides empirical evidence that rain events occur within the observation period, but the severe-weather generator's disturbance magnitudes are swept across a range of coefficient-of-variation values anchored to the validated lognormal form of Patil et al. rather than calibrated to a single corridor-specific severe-weather sample."

**AFTER**

"Severe-weather conditions are not estimated from operational data in this study but are injected as a controlled experimental variable, with disturbance magnitudes anchored to validated literature values rather than to a corridor-specific severe-weather sample." (Followed by the defense manuscript's "short empirical observation window..." paragraph, restored.)

---

### 7. methods.tex — Data Pre-Processing Pipeline (4 CapMetro stages → 3 EDSA stages)

**BEFORE**

"Pre-processing proceeds in **four** stages." — Stage 1: Filtering and validation (filter the raw APC archive by route/import-error/stop-id/direction code 6, reducing 9,197,694 → 229,421 records, SHA-256 verified); Stage 2: Temporal and weather join (join to NOAA hourly weather at Camp Mabry); Stage 3: Empirical distribution extraction; Stage 4: Train/validation split.

**AFTER**

"Pre-processing proceeds in **three** stages." — Stage 1: Cleaning (drop records with missing GPS/timestamps/negative times, filter to weekdays, bin by time-of-day); Stage 2: Empirical distribution extraction; Stage 3: Train/validation split. (The defense manuscript's SafeTravelPH-oriented pipeline.)

---

### 8. thesis_refs.bib — removed the 4 Texas-only citations

**BEFORE**

Four CapMetro/Texas bibliography entries were present: **TexasCapMetroAPC2021** (Socrata im6q-3pc9), **NOAALCDv2** (Camp Mabry, Austin), **NTD2021Fleet** (NTD ID 60048), and **CapMetroRapid801** (MetroRapid Route 801).

**AFTER**

**All four removed.** The bibliography is now identical to the defense manuscript's. (Verified: no remaining citation in the EDSA Ver text points to any of these four keys, so there are no broken references.)

---

**Why (all of the above):** `EDSA Ver/` is meant to be the pre-pivot EDSA
manuscript with the panel revisions applied and the SafeTravelPH/EDSA dataset
still in place, waiting only for that dataset. A transitional snapshot had
spliced the CapMetro dataset in and dropped the two N2 additions. These changes
remove every CapMetro/Texas/Austin reference and restore the missing content, so
the folder now faithfully matches the authoritative pre-pivot manuscript. The
parameter-summary table was already in correct EDSA form (24 stops, DOTr
schedule, SafeTravelPH source) and was left untouched; every other 2026-08-06
panel revision was already present in EDSA form and preserved.

**Cross-check performed:** after the fix, the Introduction and Methods chapters
are byte-identical to the real pre-pivot manuscript; the Problem Statement
differs only by a "TThe"→"The" typo fix and trailing whitespace; the Research
Objectives and all Expected Outputs are identical to the June 2024 defense; and
every citation key resolves.

---

*Nothing follows.*
