  Without this characterization, it cannot be determined whether reported MARL gains persist, degrade gracefully, or collapse under realistic operating disturbances, which in turn blocks the transition of MARL bus scheduling from simulation to real urban transit deployment.
+
+ The weather-disturbance class (W) in particular was identified through the literature survey conducted earlier in this study (Section~\ref{subsec:marl-applied}), which found that no prior MARL bus-scheduling paper models heavy-tailed weather-induced travel-time delays (Table~\ref{tab:marl_performance}, column W). Its operational relevance to the EDSA corridor is established by the rainfall-driven reductions in average speed and free-flow capacity documented in Section~1.1 \cite{TSSP_Rain2018} and by the typhoon-related service suspensions recorded for the corridor \cite{DOTr2020Suspension}. The lognormal parameterization adopted for this disturbance class follows the Kolmogorov--Smirnov-validated form of Patil et al.~\cite{Patil2025Conformal}, introduced in this study to address the resulting lack of temporally aligned, corridor-specific anomaly data (Section~\ref{subsec:disturbance-gap}).

**Why:** RTC comment 3 — research gap should include how the weather disturbance column was arrived at.

  ...allowing small headway perturbations to amplify into bunching \cite{Daganzo2009}. Static schedules therefore remain mathematically inadequate for stochastic traffic environments, where the governing quantities are random variables rather than deterministic constants.
+ Under the specific non-ideal conditions this study targets, the failure modes differ by control strategy. A fixed timetable has no feedback mechanism at all, so once bunching begins nothing in the schedule corrects it. A local reactive rule that holds a bus based only on the gap to the bus ahead can partially correct bunching under ordinary congestion, but has no way to respond to a breakdown, since it observes only the forward gap and not the enlarged gap a failed bus leaves behind it. A more globally aware reactive rule that accounts for both the forward and backward gap improves on this, but still follows a fixed, pre-specified rule rather than a learned response, so it cannot adapt its behavior to the heavier-tailed delays that severe weather introduces.
  These limitations motivated the transition toward more adaptive and data-driven scheduling methodologies.

  ...NC also provides the reference point for measuring the severity of bus bunching.

```

(Equivalent one-sentence additions were made to the Forward Headway and Even Headway subsections, describing their own expected failure modes — FH: can't observe the backward gap a breakdown creates; EH: no mechanism to anticipate weather's heavy tails.)

  \subsection{Stochastic Disturbance Generators}
  \label{subsec:stochastic-vars}

+ \paragraph{Disturbance Classes and Independence}
+
+ This study distinguishes five disturbance classes, denoted D, S, T, W, and B:
+
+ \begin{itemize}
+ \item \textbf{Stochastic demand (D):} the baseline, always-present day-to-day randomness in passenger arrivals, drawn from the calibrated per-(stop, time-of-day) demand distributions (Section~\ref{subsec:data-pipeline}). D is not a disturbance layered on top of a deterministic baseline; it \textit{is} the baseline stochastic environment, present in every run regardless of which other generators are active.
+ \item \textbf{Demand surge (S):} an episode-level multiplicative scaling factor, with standard deviation $\sigma_d$ (Table~\ref{tab:notation}), that amplifies baseline boarding rates above their empirical mean. S is the controlled experimental variable; D is always present, and S is what is added on top of it. Setting $\sigma_d = 0$ removes the surge and leaves only baseline demand variability (D).
+ \item \textbf{Traffic-speed perturbation (T):} an episode-level scaling of corridor cruising speed, with standard deviation $\sigma_s$, representing everyday congestion friction. T governs inter-stop travel-time variability under ideal conditions.
+ \item \textbf{Weather-induced delay (W):} a per-segment travel-time distribution with coefficient of variation $\eta$, drawn from a right-skewed lognormal rather than the Gaussian-based scaling used by T. W replaces T as the source of travel-time stochasticity once $\eta > 0$ (Section~\ref{subsec:stochastic-vars}).
+ \item \textbf{Discrete bus breakdown (B):} a Poisson-distributed discrete event, with rate $\lambda$, that permanently removes one bus from the active agent set for the remainder of the simulated day.
+ \end{itemize}
+
+ The four generators that produce S, T, W, and B are injected independently: no causal chain links them within the simulation. A breakdown event (B) does not trigger a demand surge (S) or a weather delay (W), and a weather event does not induce a mechanical failure. In practice, some real-world disturbances co-occur causally --- for example, heavy rain may both slow buses (W) and concentrate passengers at covered stops (S) --- but this study treats each generator as an independent factor. This design choice isolates the individual and combined effect of each disturbance class on controller performance and allows the single-disturbance ablation (Section~\ref{subsec:evaluation}) to attribute degradation unambiguously to a specific class.
+
  Four stochastic generators inject variability into the Python environment. Generators (i) and (ii) follow the perturbation framework of Wang and Sun~\cite{Wangsun}; the weather generator's heavy-tailed lognormal formulation follows Patil et al.~\cite{Patil2025Conformal}; the breakdown generator follows the rescheduling formulation of Cao et al.~\cite{Cao2022Train}. Table~\ref{tab:notation} collects the symbols used across this section and the MARL formulation that follows.
```

**Why:** RTC comment 8 — define each disturbance explicitly, clarify independence, distinguish stochastic demand from demand surge.

  Throughout this chapter, \textit{ideal conditions} and \textit{non-ideal conditions} refer to these operating states of the simulated environment. \textit{Baseline controllers} refers separately to the three non-MARL control strategies (No Control, Forward Headway, Even Headway) against which the MARL policy is benchmarked. A condition is a state of the world; a controller is a choice of algorithm.

  ...Sampling occurs at the start of each simulation run, producing varied demand profiles across episodes.
+ In implementation, the scaling factor $f_d \sim \mathcal{N}(1, \sigma_d^2)$ is sampled once per episode at initialization and applied uniformly to every per-stop, per-time-of-day arrival rate for the duration of that simulated operating day, so all stops experience the same proportional demand shift within a single run while the shift itself varies across runs.

  \subsection{Data Analysis Methods}

+ The three response variables logged per run are defined as follows. \textbf{Mean passenger waiting time} ($\bar{W}$) is the average time elapsed from a passenger's arrival at a stop to their successful boarding, averaged across all passengers served and all stops over one simulated operating day:
+
+ \begin{equation}
+ \bar{W} = \frac{1}{P} \sum_{p=1}^{P} \left(t_p^{\text{board}} - t_p^{\text{arrive}}\right)
+ \label{eq:waiting_time}
+ \end{equation}
+
+ where $P$ is the total number of passengers served in the run... \textbf{Mean total travel time} ($\bar{T}$) is the average elapsed time from a bus's departure from the origin terminal to its arrival at the final stop of the sub-corridor... \textbf{Headway coefficient of variation} ($CV_h$) measures headway regularity:
+
+ \begin{equation}
+ CV_h = \frac{\sigma_h}{\mu_h}
+ \label{eq:headway_cv}
+ \end{equation}
+
+ where $\sigma_h$ and $\mu_h$ are the standard deviation and mean of observed inter-bus headways... This construction mirrors the baseline coefficient of variation $CV_0$ already defined for travel time (Table~\ref{tab:notation}), applied here to the headway distribution instead.
+
  For each (control strategy, disturbance level) cell, $N \geq 30$ independent Monte Carlo runs are executed using matched random seeds across strategies. Three response variables are logged per run: mean passenger waiting time, mean total travel time, and headway coefficient of variation.

A continuous holding parameter $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ was considered, following Wang and Sun~\cite{Wangsun}, but rejected for three reasons. First, continuous actions require actor-critic algorithms, whose training instability compounds across the swept-disturbance evaluation budget. Second, Rodriguez et al.~\cite{Rodriguez2023Cooperative} showed that a 5-bin discretization of $\alpha$ achieves combined holding-and-skipping control on a comparable corridor without measurable loss of performance versus continuous formulations.

+ The full action set is the Cartesian product of these two components: $|A_i| = 5 \times 2 = 10$ discrete actions per control event, allowing the agent to select a holding strength and a skip decision independently at each control event. This is a broader action space than Rodriguez et al.~\cite{Rodriguez2023Cooperative}, whose combined holding-and-skipping controller (DDQN-HA) instead selects among six \textit{mutually exclusive} actions: five holding strengths $\Omega = \{0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4\}$ (with $\omega = 0$ already covering the no-holding case) plus a single skip action. The discretized holding-strength set $\Omega$ adopted here matches theirs exactly. A continuous holding parameter $\alpha \in [0, 1]$ was considered, following Wang and Sun~\cite{Wangsun}, but rejected for two reasons. First, continuous actions require actor-critic algorithms, whose training instability compounds across the swept-disturbance evaluation budget. Second, real driver compliance with holding instructions is itself imperfect: Rodriguez et al.~\cite{Rodriguez2023Cooperative} model non-compliant drivers as departing after only 60--80\% of the instructed holding time, so continuous precision in $\alpha$ is not meaningful at deployment.
```

**Why:** Verified against the actual PDF. No continuous-vs-discrete comparison exists anywhere in the paper — that claim was unsupported. Rodriguez's actual action space is 6 mutually-exclusive actions, not this study's 10-action independent Cartesian space. Kept the thesis's own $|A_i|=10$ design unchanged (load-bearing elsewhere); only corrected what is attributed to Rodriguez.

Applied the same note to methods.tex Figures 3.1–3.5 for consistency (also original, previously unattributed — flagged as in-scope in REVISION_QUEUE.md: "3.1–3.5 appear original"). Figures 1.1 and 1.2 already had citations and were left unchanged.

- \textbf{Delimitations.} (a) Due to computational constraints, the simulation is restricted to a defined operational sub-segment of the EDSA Carousel corridor rather than the entire metropolitan road network. The restriction is justified by the need to preserve 1:1 empirical traffic volumes for GEH calibration without resorting to flow scaling; corresponding GEH calibration statistics are reported in Chapter~4.
+ \textbf{Delimitations.} (a) Due to computational constraints, the simulation is restricted to a defined operational sub-segment of the EDSA Carousel corridor rather than the entire metropolitan road network, and minor feeder roads leading into the corridor are not modeled. Both restrictions are justified by the same structural fact: the EDSA Carousel operates on a physically separated, barrier-protected busway \cite{Chua2026}, so the agents' state and reward depend only on bus dynamics within the dedicated lane, specifically headways, dwell times, and onboard loads, none of which are directly observed by or computed from feeder-road traffic. Feeder roads affect the corridor only indirectly, through the passenger arrival rates they produce at each stop, and that effect is already captured by the calibrated per-stop demand distributions (Section~3.2.5) without needing to simulate the feeder network itself. Modeling feeder roads in SUMO would add computational cost without adding any new information the agents' observation or reward could use, since the sub-corridor restriction also preserves 1:1 empirical traffic volumes for GEH calibration without resorting to flow scaling; corresponding GEH calibration statistics are reported in Chapter~4.
```

**Why:** RTC comment 14 — justify why minor roads leading to the corridor are no longer considered.

**Why:** RTC comment 16 — figures and tables should be called and discussed in the paragraphs, not just placed. A sweep of all 15 figures/tables found 10 with zero `\ref{}` anywhere despite adjacent topical discussion; added one reference each without altering the discussion itself. Table 3.1 (tab:notation) — the RTC's own example of a too-thin callout — was checked and found to already have 5 separate substantive references elsewhere in the chapter, so it needed no fix beyond what existed.

Also added `\label{subsec:control-stop-selection}` to the previously-unlabeled "Control-Stop Selection" subsection, and fixed two cross-references that initially pointed at the wrong label (`subsec:data-pipeline`) before that label existed.

**Why:** RTC comment 2 — map dataset fields to proposed features of the study. Judged safe to do without dataset access: connects two already-published specs (required fields in 3.2.5, MARL components in 3.2.6/3.2.7/3.2.2) rather than describing the actual dataset's contents, unlike the reverted E1C1/E2C5/E4C22 task.

**Why:** RTC comment 17 — include figures/tables shown in the defense but missing from the manuscript. Reviewed all 58 slides of the group's defense deck against the manuscript; most slide content duplicated existing prose/figures. These two were genuinely new: the corridor map (matches the RTC letter's own example of what might be missing) and the η-basis table (existing prose converted to table form, prose kept unchanged). See TRACKER.md for full reasoning on what was judged out of scope (Work Plan Gantt charts, software/tools appendix).

**Process note:** the corridor map image was extracted from slide 47 of `B3-Final-Defense.pdf` (rendered at 3x resolution via PyMuPDF, cropped to the map graphic, saved as `Figures/bg_fig3_edsa_corridor_map.pdf`). This repo has no `Figures/` directory otherwise — existing `\includegraphics` calls reference images that live only on Overleaf. The user needs to upload this new file to Overleaf's Figures folder for the manuscript to compile there.

  ...This study defines the reward \textit{structure} for the hybrid action space, the three component terms above, and treats their relative weighting, plus a sensitivity analysis over those weights, as the implementation-phase deliverable (EO 2.1). The component structure is fixed; the coefficients are not yet finalized.
+
+ The reward is computed individually for each agent at every control event, not as a shared team-level signal: $r_{i,t}$ is agent $i$'s own entry in the transition $(s_{i,t}, a_{i,t}, r_{i,t}, s_{i,t'})$ written to the shared replay buffer (Training and Execution Protocol, step 4), so each bus is scored on the consequences of its own action even though all agents update the same shared network.

**Why:** self-identified gap (user notice, not an RTC comment) — the existing text defined the reward's *priorities* and deferred *weighting* to EO 2.1, but never explained the reward's *mechanics*: whether it's individual or shared, how the three priorities combine into a scalar, or the sign convention. Added those three things without touching the existing structure/weighting distinction or specifying any coefficient value.

**Commit:** not yet committed

```diff
  Without this characterization, it cannot be determined whether reported MARL gains persist, degrade gracefully, or collapse under realistic operating disturbances, which in turn blocks the transition of MARL bus scheduling from simulation to real urban transit deployment.
+ This joint-disturbance framing reflects two independently-documented, concurrent operational realities of the same corridor rather than only a gap in existing comparison tables: EDSA experiences both weather-driven service disruptions \cite{PhilstarTyphoon2024, PIA_Emergency2023} and chronic mechanical-failure risk \cite{Chua2026} as ongoing features of its operating environment, so a controller validated against each in isolation provides no evidence of how it behaves when a transit operator's actual risk exposure includes both at once. The disturbance generators remain independently sampled within the simulation (Section~3.2.6); this operational context motivates evaluating their union, not a claim that the two are causally or temporally linked.

  The weather-disturbance class (W) in particular was identified through the literature survey conducted earlier in this study...
```

**Why:** self-identified. Grounds the "combined disturbance" framing in an EDSA-specific operational fact rather than presenting it as only a gap in existing MARL comparison tables (Table~\ref{tab:marl_performance}), while explicitly preserving the existing independence statement in Section~3.2.6 so the two additions don't contradict each other.

  ...Existing MARL bus-control reward formulations span a range of trade-offs among these priorities, from headway-coefficient-of-variation forms for holding-only action spaces \cite{Wangsun,Wang2023MultiObj} to passenger-time forms for combined holding-and-skipping action spaces \cite{Rodriguez2023Cooperative}.
- This study defines the reward \textit{structure} for the hybrid action space, the three component terms above, and treats their relative weighting, plus a sensitivity analysis over those weights, as the implementation-phase deliverable (EO 2.1). The component structure is fixed; the coefficients are not yet finalized.
-
- The reward is computed individually for each agent at every control event, not as a shared team-level signal: $r_{i,t}$ is agent $i$'s own entry in the transition $(s_{i,t}, a_{i,t}, r_{i,t}, s_{i,t'})$ written to the shared replay buffer (Training and Execution Protocol, step 4), so each bus is scored on the consequences of its own action even though all agents update the same shared network. Locally-observable quantities already in $s_{i,t}$, principally the forward and backward headway components $h^-$ and $\hat{h}^+$, let this individual signal still reflect corridor-wide regularity without requiring a centralized reward computation at execution time. The three priorities combine additively as a weighted sum of per-event penalty terms,
+ This study establishes the overall reward structure for the hybrid action space by defining the three reward components and their additive formulation, while treating the corresponding weighting coefficients, together with their sensitivity analysis, as the implementation-phase deliverable under Expected Output 2.1. Although the component structure is fixed at this stage, the coefficients remain as placeholders to be determined during implementation through experimental evaluation.
+
+ The reward is computed independently for each agent at every control event rather than as a shared team-level objective. Accordingly, $r_{i,t}$ represents the reward assigned to agent $i$ and is stored as that agent's transition in the shared replay buffer (Training and Execution Protocol, step 4). Each bus is therefore evaluated based on the consequences of its own action, even though all agents learn from a common shared network. Since the reward is derived from locally observable quantities already contained in the agent's observation, particularly the forward and backward headway measurements, the resulting signal remains aligned with corridor-wide service regularity without requiring a centralized reward computation during execution.
+
+ The overall reward function is expressed as the weighted sum of three penalty terms:

  \begin{equation}
  r_{i,t+k} = -w_1 \cdot (\text{headway-irregularity term}) - w_2 \cdot (\text{waiting-time term}) - w_3 \cdot (\text{skip-degeneracy term}),
  \label{eq:reward-form}
  \end{equation}

- with weights $w_1, w_2, w_3$ \%TODO-VAL: to be tuned as the Expected Output 2.1 sensitivity analysis. Each term is expressed as a non-positive penalty, so the agent maximizes its expected return in Eq.~\eqref{eq:bellman} by simultaneously minimizing headway irregularity, passenger waiting, and degenerate skipping; this sign convention, not the specific per-term formulas or their relative weights, is what this chapter fixes ahead of implementation.
+ where $w_1$, $w_2$, and $w_3$ denote the weighting coefficients (\%TODO-VAL) to be determined through the Expected Output 2.1 sensitivity analysis. Each component is formulated as a non-positive penalty, allowing the agent to maximize its cumulative return in Eq.~\eqref{eq:bellman} by minimizing headway irregularity, passenger waiting time, and unnecessary stop-skipping behavior. Consequently, this chapter establishes the reward formulation and its optimization objective, while the specific mathematical expressions and coefficient values are reserved for the implementation and evaluation phase.
```

**Why:** the user supplied polished replacement prose for N1's content and asked that it be applied. The equation itself (Eq. eq:reward-form) is unchanged; the surrounding prose was rewritten for tone/flow, folding "additive formulation" language earlier into the structure paragraph and restating the mechanics/sign-convention paragraph in the user's own wording. Kept the `%TODO-VAL` placeholder tag on the weighting coefficients (the user's text didn't include it, but CLAUDE.md's placeholder convention requires it for greppability) and the existing citations/priority list in the untouched first half of the structure paragraph.

  \subsubsection{Required Datasets}

  \begin{itemize}

- \item \textbf{Corridor bus operational data.} A per-trip record of EDSA Carousel bus operation along the study sub-corridor, collected over a continuous observation window of at least two weeks. The required fields are GPS-tracked vehicle location, boarding and alighting events, passenger occupancy, operating speed, and \textit{dwell time} at each stop, the dwell time being the interval a bus spends stationary at a stop serving passengers, measured from the moment the doors open to the moment they close and the bus is ready to depart, exclusive of any holding time subsequently imposed by the controller. These records yield the empirical distributions of bus cruising speed, inter-stop travel time, and demand under ideal operating conditions, used both to calibrate SUMO and to define the baseline operating point of the stochastic generators. The baseline operating point for this study is established from a crowdsourced operational record collected from the EDSA Busway during July 2023 through the SafeTravelPH mobile application.
+ \item \textbf{Corridor bus operational data (primary).} The primary operational dataset is the Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority (CapMetro) Automatic Passenger Counter (APC) raw archive for July--December 2021~\cite{TexasCapMetroAPC2021}, published on the Texas Open Data Portal (Socrata dataset ID \texttt{im6q-3pc9}). The full archive contains 9,197,694 stop-level event records across 47 fields. Each record represents a single bus stop visit and includes: calendar and temporal fields (\texttt{service\_date}, \texttt{calendar\_id}, \texttt{day\_of\_week}); route and trip identifiers (\texttt{route\_id}, \texttt{current\_route\_id}, \texttt{trip\_id}, \texttt{direction\_code\_id}); stop-level spatial data (\texttt{bs\_id}, \texttt{stop\_sequence}, GPS coordinates); passenger activity (\texttt{ons}, \texttt{offs}, \texttt{load}, \texttt{max\_load}); temporal measurements (\texttt{departure\_dtm}, \texttt{map\_data\_tmstmp}, scheduled versus actual arrival differences); vehicle identifiers (\texttt{vehicle\_id}); and data quality flags (\texttt{import\_error}, \texttt{import\_trip\_error}).
+
+ This study uses the subset corresponding to MetroRapid Route 801 (North Lamar/South Congress BRT corridor), direction code 6 (northbound), operated by New Flyer Xcelsior XDE60 articulated buses with a crush capacity of approximately 123 passengers~\cite{NTD2021Fleet,CapMetroRapid801}. [...]
+
+ After cleaning (Section~\ref{subsec:data-pipeline}), the usable subset comprises 229,421 stop-level event records spanning 184 service days with a total of 420,201 recorded boardings. [...]
+
+ \item \textbf{Weather data (secondary).} Hourly surface observations from NOAA Local Climatological Data Version~2~\cite{NOAALCDv2}, covering the same July--December 2021 period. [...]

  \subsubsection{Data Pre-Processing Pipeline}
  \label{subsec:data-pipeline}

- Pre-processing proceeds in three stages.
+ Pre-processing proceeds in four stages.

- \textit{Stage 1: Cleaning.} Trip records with missing GPS coordinates, missing timestamps, negative inter-stop times, or trips that fail integrity checks (for example, a later stop served before an earlier one) are dropped. Remaining records are normalized to a common time zone. [...]
+ \textit{Stage 1: Filtering and validation.} The raw APC archive is filtered to the study subset using four sequential rules: (1)~route consistency (\texttt{current\_route\_id} equals \texttt{route\_id}), which removes records where the vehicle was reassigned mid-trip; (2)~import-error exclusion (\texttt{import\_error}~$= 0$ and \texttt{import\_trip\_error}~$= 0$), which removes records flagged by the APC system as unreliable; (3)~valid stop identification (\texttt{bs\_id}~$\neq 0$), which removes records with unresolved stop references; and (4)~direction selection (\texttt{direction\_code\_id}~$= 6$), which isolates the northbound service direction. These filters reduce the archive from 9,197,694 records to 229,421 records spanning 184 service days and 29 stop IDs, with 420,201 total boardings. Output integrity is verified by comparing the SHA-256 checksum of the cleaned file against an independently produced reference.

+ \textit{Stage 2: Temporal and weather join.} Cleaned stop-visit records are joined to NOAA hourly weather observations~\cite{NOAALCDv2} by rounding the departure timestamp to the nearest hour and matching to the Camp Mabry station record. [...]

- \textit{Stage 2: Empirical distribution extraction.} [...]
+ \textit{Stage 3: Empirical distribution extraction.} [unchanged content, renumbered]
